How to launch the program ?

1- Use the "make" command in the terminal
2- Use the binary named "paint" that have been created (./paint)

Now you should be on a graphical interface allowing you to draw :)

Help:

If you're seeking help, click on the "?" button on the interface, then on the book. A text should appear on your terminal.

Save:

Whenever you want to save, click on the folder button. Then on the last button of the folder menu. Go back to your terminal and enter a valid name. A file will be created with your beautiful drawing. You can't interact with the graphical window while saving a file.
